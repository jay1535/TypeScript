/*
To specify the type of an array like [1, 2, 3], you can use the syntax number[]; 
this syntax works for any type (e.g. string[] is an array of strings, and so on).
 You may also see this written as Array<number>, which means the same thing.
 We’ll learn more about the syntax T<U> when we cover generics.
